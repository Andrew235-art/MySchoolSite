# MySchoolSite - A Sample School Website

## Description

MySchoolSite is a sample project demonstrating a basic multi-page website for an educational institution. It includes essential pages like Home, About Us, Admissions, and a Contact page with a functional form (front-end only). The project is built using HTML and CSS.

## Current Status

**This project is currently a work in progress.** While the basic structure and several key features are implemented, further enhancements, content population, and styling refinements are ongoing.

## Features

*   **Homepage (`index.html`):** Welcomes visitors and provides an overview, including a class schedule and important times.
*   **About Us (`about.html`):** Shares information about the school's mission, history, vision, values, faculty, and campus.
*   **Admissions (`admissions.html`):** Details the admission process, requirements, important dates, and includes a section for FAQs.
*   **Contact (`contact.html`):** Provides contact information (address, email, phone) and a contact form for inquiries.
*   **Basic Styling:** Includes a `reset.css` for browser consistency and a `style.css` for the overall look and feel.
*   **Responsive Design Elements:** Basic considerations for various screen sizes have been included.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML5
